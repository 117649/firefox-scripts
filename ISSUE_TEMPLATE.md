Please, read:
- I don't have time to fix any other legacy extension for you, so please don't ask;
- this is not a place for general support about legacy extension development;
- all legacy extensions here are in maintenance mode (no new features, just fixes) - remember that I'm not the original developer of them;
- I'm not going to write a new script that I don't intend to use.
