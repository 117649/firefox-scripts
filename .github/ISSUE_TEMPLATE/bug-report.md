<!--
Please, read:
- If you want to report a script issue, make sure you have the latest version of every file. Scripts and userChromeJS don't have auto update, so maybe your issue was already fixed.
- I don't have time to fix any other legacy extension for you, so please don't ask.
- This is not a place for general support about legacy extension development, but you may try using Discussions (https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts/discussions) and hope someone shows up to help.
- All legacy extensions here are in maintenance mode (no new features, just fixes). Remember that I'm not the original developer of them.
- Suggestions for new scripts are usually rejected because I'm not going to write a code I don't intend to use.
- Invalid issues as per above will be promptly closed.
