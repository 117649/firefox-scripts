Original description

Fast Tab Switcher allows you to find and switch to any tab immediately. It is keyboard-oriented and very useful if there are multiple windows and/or lots of tabs opened.

Hotkey combination (it is Ctrl+Space by default, but can be changed) opens the dialog window with tab list. Start typing the title or url (any part or word) of the tab you would like to switch to and press Enter.

\- Tab list is filtering as you are typing

\- Tab list is sorted in MRU order (most recent tab first)

\- Tab list contains all tabs in every browser window
